# Stigmergy SDD Enhancement Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of Specification-Driven Development (SDD) and advanced document intelligence capabilities in the Stigmergy system.

## Overview

The enhancements integrate core concepts from the github-spec-kit and hkuds-deepcode repositories into the existing Stigmergy system, evolving it into a more robust, reliable, and user-friendly autonomous development platform.

## Key Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Specification-Driven Development Integration

#### @specifier Agent
- Created a new agent (`specifier.md`) responsible for SDD workflow
- Agent handles specification creation using templates
- Implements plan generation with technical stack, data models, and API contracts
- Manages ambiguity resolution with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] methodology

#### Enhanced Constitution
- Updated the Stigmergy constitution with SDD principles
- Added explicit reference to @qa agent and qa.run_tests_and_check_coverage tool
- Formalized the specification → plan → implementation workflow
- Ensured constitutional compliance for all agents

#### Templates
- Created specification template (`spec-template.md`) for structured output
- Created implementation plan template (`plan-template.md`) with technical details

### 2. Advanced Document Intelligence Enhancement

#### Semantic Segmentation
- Enhanced `document_intelligence.js` with improved semantic segmentation
- Better preservation of algorithms, formulas, and technical content
- Enhanced pattern extraction for research papers and technical documents
- Added support for algorithmic and mathematical pattern recognition

### 3. Concise Memory Execution Strategy

#### Memory Management
- Implemented context summarization in `tool_executor.js`
- Added memory management strategy to prevent conversation history overflow
- Triggers summarization after writeFile operations
- Maintains essential context while reducing memory footprint

### 4. Dispatcher Workflow Enhancement

#### Updated Workflow
- Modified the @dispatcher agent to integrate with the new @specifier agent
- Added SPECIFICATION_PHASE to the state machine
- Enhanced STATE_DRIVEN_ORCHESTRATION_PROTOCOL to delegate to @specifier first

### 5. Configuration Updates

#### New Features
- Added SDD configuration options to `stigmergy.config.js`
- Added document intelligence configuration
- Added memory management configuration

### 6. Directory Structure

#### Specs Directory
- Created `specs/` directory for specification repository
- Created sample structure for feature specifications

## Implementation Files

1. `.stigmergy-core/agents/specifier.md` - New @specifier agent definition
2. `.stigmergy-core/governance/constitution.md` - Enhanced constitution with SDD principles
3. `.stigmergy-core/templates/spec-template.md` - Specification template
4. `.stigmergy-core/templates/plan-template.md` - Implementation plan template
5. `.stigmergy-core/agents/dispatcher.md` - Updated dispatcher agent workflow
6. `tools/document_intelligence.js` - Enhanced document intelligence capabilities
7. `engine/tool_executor.js` - Memory management implementation
8. `stigmergy.config.js` - Configuration updates
9. `specs/` - Directory structure for specifications

## Benefits

- **Native Integration**: Core concepts re-implemented natively within Stigmergy's existing JavaScript/Node.js architecture
- **Preserved Architecture**: All changes respect and extend Stigmergy's existing multi-agent swarm and MCP-based architecture
- **Unified User Experience**: New capabilities seamlessly integrated into the Stigmergy chat interface
- **JavaScript First**: All new core logic implemented in JavaScript/Node.js
- **Test Everything**: Every new or modified workflow accompanied by integration tests
- **Document as You Go**: Documentation updated to reflect new capabilities

## Next Steps

1. Implement integration tests for the SDD workflow
2. Create documentation for the new features
3. Add examples and tutorials for using the SDD capabilities
4. Monitor and optimize the memory management strategy
5. Enhance the document intelligence capabilities with more advanced pattern recognition
