# Example Use Case: Building a SaaS Application

This example demonstrates how Stigmergy can be used to build a complete Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application from a single high-level goal.

## The Goal

The project starts with a simple but ambitious goal given to the system:

> "Build a SaaS platform called 'Insightify' that allows users to sign up, submit a URL, and receive a detailed SEO analysis report. The platform should have a user dashboard and a subscription-based payment system."

## The Process: A Bird's-Eye View

Stigmergy would tackle this goal through a series of phases, orchestrated by the `@dispatcher` agent.

### 1. **Phase 1: Planning & Design**

- **`@pm` (Project Manager)**: Takes the goal and breaks it down into a comprehensive project plan, defining epics and user stories (e.g., "As a user, I can create an account," "As a user, I can submit a URL for analysis").
- **`@analyst`**: Researches existing SEO analysis tools and best practices using `research.deep_dive`.
- **`@design-architect`**: Designs the system architecture. This includes:
  - A React frontend with components for the landing page, dashboard, and settings.
  - A Node.js/Express backend with API endpoints for user authentication, URL submission, and report generation.
  - A MongoDB database schema for users, websites, and reports.
  - Integration with the Stripe API for payments.

### 2. **Phase 2: Execution**

- The `@dispatcher` breaks down the architect's plan into smaller, actionable tasks.
- **`@dev` (Frontend)**: Receives tasks like "Create the user signup form component in React." It uses `file_system.writeFile` to create the necessary `.js` and `.css` files.
- **`@dev` (Backend)**: Receives tasks like "Implement the `/api/users/signup` endpoint." It writes the server-side logic, including password hashing and database interaction.
- **`@dev` (Integration)**: A specialized `@dev` agent might be tasked with "Integrate the Stripe API for subscription management." This agent would use `research.deep_dive` to read Stripe's documentation and then implement the required webhooks and API calls.

### 3. **Phase 3: Verification & Quality Assurance**

- **`@qa`**: As features are completed, the `@qa` agent is dispatched to write tests. It uses `file_system.readFile` to understand the code and `file_system.writeFile` to create test files (e.g., `signup.test.js`). It then uses `shell.execute` to run the tests (`npm test`).
- **`@debugger`**: If a test fails, the `@debugger` is automatically triggered. It reads the test output, uses `code_intelligence.findUsages` to trace the problem, and attempts to fix the buggy code.

### 4. **Phase 4: Deployment (Hypothetical)**

- While not a built-in feature yet, a custom `@deployer` agent could be created.
- This agent would be given tools to interact with a cloud provider's CLI (e.g., `aws`, `gcloud`).
- It could be tasked with "Deploy the latest version of the application to production," which would involve running shell commands to build Docker containers, push them to a registry, and update a Kubernetes deployment.

## Conclusion

This example shows how Stigmergy can manage a complex, multi-faceted project by breaking it down and assigning tasks to a team of specialized agents. Each agent works on a small piece of the puzzle, and the system as a whole coordinates their efforts to achieve the high-level goal.
