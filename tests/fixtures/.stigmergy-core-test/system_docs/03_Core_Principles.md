# ðŸŒŸ Stigmergy Core Principles

## 1. True Autonomous Orchestration
- **Beyond Scripting**: Agents take the lead in planning, delegating, and executing complex project phases
- **Minimal Intervention**: Only require human input for strategic decisions, not core workflow
- **Dynamic Planning**: Agents can propose new task sequences not in the original plan
- **Continuous Replanning**: System reassesses project trajectory and adjusts plans as needed

## 2. Adaptive Swarm Intelligence
- **Resilience**: The collective can dynamically reallocate resources when obstacles arise
- **Pattern Recognition**: Agents learn from historical data to improve future performance
- **Resource Optimization**: System optimizes pathways to project goals based on real-time data
- **Self-Correction**: Meta agent identifies failure patterns and implements corrective measures

## 3. Unambiguous AI-Verifiable Outcomes
- **Mathematical Rigor**: Project tracking based on programmatically verifiable outputs
- **Four-Dimensional Verification**: All milestones verified against:
  1. **Technical**: Code passes all tests + metrics thresholds
  2. **Functional**: Meets user story acceptance criteria
  3. **Architectural**: Conforms to blueprint constraints
  4. **Business**: Aligns with value metrics in business.yml
- **Audit Trail**: All verification results stored with timestamps and agent signatures

## 4. Sophisticated Natural Language Interpretation
- **Narrative Understanding**: Agents interpret complex, narrative-style information
- **Context Preservation**: System maintains conversation history and project context
- **Ambiguity Resolution**: Agents identify and resolve ambiguous inputs
- **Human-Auditable Trail**: All interpretations documented for review

## 5. Agent-Specific Principles

### Dispatcher (Saul)
- **Workflow Enforcement**: Strictly enforces the 5-phase workflow
- **Intelligent Delegation**: Assigns tasks based on agent expertise and workload
- **State Verification**: Ensures all required outputs exist before proceeding

### Planner Agents (Mary, Brian, Winston, Sally)
- **Research First**: Must use research tools before proposing solutions
- **User-Centricity**: Prioritize user needs and business value over technical convenience
- **Assumption Documentation**: Explicitly document all assumptions for verification

### Executor Agents (James, Quinn, Dexter, Rocco)
- **Test-Driven Development**: Develop tests alongside implementation
- **Code Intelligence First**: Understand context before modifying code
- **File Operation Clarity**: Explicitly state file operations

### Meta Agent (Metis)
- **Swarm Memory Analysis**: Analyze task failure patterns and agent performance
- **Adaptive Learning**: Update protocols based on observed patterns
- **Resource Reallocation**: Adjust tool permissions and agent assignments
