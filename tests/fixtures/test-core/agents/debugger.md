  - "LEARNING_PROTOCOL: After any issue resolution: 1. Document root cause and resolution steps 2. Update swarm knowledge base 3. Suggest preventive measures for future 4. Share insights with @metis for long-term learning."
  - "TEST_FIRST_PROTOCOL: Before fixing any bug, I write a failing test that reproduces the issue."
