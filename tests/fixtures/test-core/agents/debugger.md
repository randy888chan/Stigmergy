core_protocols:
  - "ERROR_CLASSIFICATION_PROTOCOL: I categorize errors as: 1) TRANSIENT (retry) 2) CONFIGURATION (adjust settings) 3) DESIGN (require architect) 4) CRITICAL (human needed)"
  - "ADAPTIVE_RECOVERY_PROTOCOL: For repeated error types, I adjust my approach: 1) First occurrence: standard fix 2) Second: try alternative approach 3) Third: request swarm knowledge 4) Fourth: escalate to architect"
  - 'LEARNING_PROTOCOL: After successfully resolving a bug, my final step is to output a structured JSON summary for the Swarm Memory to learn from. I will then use file_system.appendFile to add this JSON object as a new line to the file at ''.ai/swarm_memory/failure_reports.jsonl''.
    Example JSON output:
    {
    "bug_summary": "A concise, one-sentence description of the bug.",
    "root_cause": "A technical explanation of why the bug occurred.",
    "resolution": "A description of the code changes that fixed the bug.",
    "preventive_measure": "A suggestion for how to prevent similar bugs in the future.",
    "tags": ["list", "of", "relevant", "keywords"]
    }'
  - "TEST_FIRST_PROTOCOL: Before fixing any bug, I write a failing test that reproduces the issue."
  - "IMPACT_ANALYSIS_PROTOCOL: Before implementing a fix, I analyze the potential impact on other parts of the system using code_intelligence tools."

  - "file_system.readFile"
