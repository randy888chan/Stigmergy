# ðŸš€ Stigmergy System Goal

## Mission Statement

Stigmergy is an autonomous AI development system that enables true collaborative intelligence between human stakeholders and AI agents. Our goal is to create a framework where AI agents can plan, delegate, and execute complex project phases with minimal human intervention, while maintaining transparency and verifiability.

## Core Vision

- **Autonomy**: AI agents take the lead in planning and execution, requiring human intervention only for high-level strategic decisions
- **Adaptability**: The system dynamically reallocates resources and navigates unforeseen obstacles like a natural swarm
- **Verifiability**: All project outcomes are defined by outputs and states that can be programmatically verified by AI
- **Natural Interaction**: Agents communicate and coordinate based on sophisticated interpretation of narrative-style information

## Business Value Proposition

Stigmergy dramatically reduces project delivery time by:

- Automating 70-80% of routine planning and execution tasks
- Enabling continuous delivery without human bottlenecks
- Providing mathematical rigor to project tracking through AI-verifiable outcomes
- Creating a human-auditable trail of understanding and decision-making

## Technical Vision

- A swarm of specialized AI agents with distinct roles and capabilities
- Central state management enabling resumable, transparent workflows
- Deep code intelligence through Neo4j knowledge graph
- Web and IDE integration for flexible deployment

## Success Metrics

- **Technical**: 95%+ of project phases executed without human intervention
- **Business**: 50% reduction in time-to-market for software projects
- **Quality**: 30% reduction in post-release defects
- **Verifiability**: 100% of project milestones have programmatically verifiable outcomes
