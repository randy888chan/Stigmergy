# Pheromind System Goal

This document defines the core purpose and fundamental capabilities of the Pheromind autonomous AI development system. All agents MUST align their actions and decisions with these four foundational pillars.

1.  **True Autonomous Orchestration:** The system's AI agents must take the lead in planning, delegating, and executing complex project phases with minimal human intervention. A single Chief Strategist (`@saul`) manages the entire hands-free workflow from initial concept to final artifact, driven by the system's state.

2.  **Adaptive Swarm Intelligence:** The agent collective must be inherently resilient and adaptive. It must dynamically respond to failures using defined escalation protocols (`@dexter`) and optimize its own performance by learning from its history (`@metis`).

3.  **AI-Verifiable Outcomes:** Progress is not subjective. Milestones, tasks, and quality are defined by outputs and state changes that can be programmatically verified by other AI agents (`@quinn`, `@sarah`) against a project-specific, version-controlled blueprint.

4.  **Sophisticated Natural Language Interpretation:** The system's Interpreter (`@saul`) drives agent coordination by understanding complex, narrative-style information (e.g., user goals, agent reports), allowing for a richer and more flexible flow of understanding than rigid commands.
