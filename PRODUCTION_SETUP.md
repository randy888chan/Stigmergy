# 🚀 Stigmergy Production Setup Guide

Your Stigmergy system has been successfully implemented with all the discussed features! Here's what you need to do to get it fully operational:

## ✅ What's Already Working

- ✅ **Neo4j Database**: Connected and operational
- ✅ **Agent Definitions**: All agents validated successfully
- ✅ **Core Architecture**: Complete multi-executor system (dev/gemini/qwen)
- ✅ **CodeRAG Integration**: Ready for semantic code search
- ✅ **Lightweight Archon**: Replaces Docker dependency
- ✅ **Tool Integrations**: SuperDesign, MCP Code Search, Qwen integration
- ✅ **Provider Isolation**: Prevents LLM conflicts between Stigmergy and Roo Code
- ✅ **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive system health checks

## 🔧 Required Configuration

### 1. Configure AI Providers (REQUIRED)

Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Primary AI Provider (OpenRouter - Recommended)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
OPENROUTER_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
```

**Get OpenRouter API Key**: https://openrouter.ai/keys
- OpenRouter provides unified access to multiple AI models
- Supports Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, and many others through one API

### 2. Optional but Recommended Integrations

```bash
# Research and Web Crawling
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_firecrawl_api_key_here

# Qwen Code Integration (Advanced coding)
QWEN_API_KEY=your_qwen_api_key_here
QWEN_BASE_URL=https://api.qwen.com/v1

# GitHub Integration (for SuperDesign and MCP)
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here

# Optional: Supabase (for Lightweight Archon fallback)
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## 🚀 How to Start

### Option 1: Production Start (Recommended)
```bash
npm run stigmergy:start
```
This runs health checks, initializes CodeRAG, and starts the server.

### Option 2: Development Start
```bash
npm run stigmergy:dev
```
Starts the server directly without health checks.

### Option 3: Manual Health Check First
```bash
npm run health-check
npm start
```

## 🤖 Agent Capabilities

Your system now includes these specialized agents:

1. **Enhanced Dev** (`@james+`): Advanced code intelligence with semantic search
2. **Qwen Executor** (`@qwen-executor`): Complex algorithms and optimization
3. **Gemini Executor** (`@gemini-executor`): Quick prototypes and boilerplate
4. **Context Preparer**: Intelligent context gathering
5. **All Standard Agents**: QA, Debugger, Guardian, etc.

## 🔍 Agent Selection Logic

The supervisor automatically chooses:
- **Dev Agent**: General development and legacy code
- **Gemini Executor**: Quick prototypes and boilerplate generation  
- **Qwen Executor**: Complex algorithms, optimization, advanced patterns

## 🛠️ Available Tools

Each agent has access to appropriate tools:

- **CodeRAG**: Semantic code search and intelligence
- **Lightweight Archon**: Multi-source knowledge queries
- **SuperDesign**: Design generation capabilities
- **MCP Code Search**: Advanced code search through IDE
- **Qwen Integration**: Advanced code generation and review
- **Standard Tools**: File system, shell, research, etc.

## 📊 Monitoring

Check system health anytime:
```bash
npm run health-check
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If you get API key errors:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Add your OpenRouter API key
3. Run `npm run health-check` to verify

### If agents seem limited:
- Add optional API keys for full functionality
- Qwen Code requires separate API key for advanced features
- Firecrawl enables research capabilities

### If CodeRAG isn't working:
- Ensure Neo4j is running (already configured in your case)
- Run `npm run coderag:init` to initialize manually

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Add API Keys**: Start with OpenRouter (required)
2. **Run Health Check**: `npm run health-check`
3. **Start System**: `npm run stigmergy:start`
4. **Test Agents**: Try different agent types for various tasks
5. **Monitor Performance**: Use health checks regularly

## 🆘 Support

Your system is production-ready! All the discussed features have been implemented:
- ✅ LLM provider isolation (no more conflicts with Roo Code)
- ✅ Lightweight Archon (no Docker dependency)
- ✅ Complete CodeRAG integration
- ✅ Three-executor architecture
- ✅ All tool integrations

The automation issues should be resolved with the provider isolation system.

Happy coding with Stigmergy! 🎉
