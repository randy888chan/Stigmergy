# Story Implementation Expansion Pack

## Overview
Comprehensive end-to-end story implementation workflows with dual-variant approach, extensive validation systems, and intelligent learning extraction. Transforms epic context into production-ready deliverables with built-in quality gates and continuous improvement mechanisms.

## Purpose
Addresses the complexity gap in agile story implementation by providing:
- **Progressive validation**: Epic readiness → Story approval → Implementation → Quality review
- **Dual workflow variants**: Simple (9 steps, 2-3 days) vs Standard (15 steps, 4-5 days)
- **Comprehensive review system**: Round 1 multi-agent reviews + Round 2+ efficient validation
- **Learning extraction**: Structured triage system feeding future epics and process improvement
- **Epic progress tracking**: Automatic completion tracking with retrospective triggers

## Installation

```bash
# Install the story implementation expansion pack
bmad install expansion-pack story-implementation

# Verify installation
bmad list expansion-packs
```

## Usage Examples

### Simple Story Implementation
```bash
# For UI changes, content updates, simple fixes
*workflow story-simple epic_number=5 story_number=3

# Example output: Epic 5, Story 3 implemented with 9 validation steps
```

### Full Feature Implementation  
```bash
# For complex features, business logic, integrations
*workflow story-implementation epic_number=12 story_number=7

# Example output: Epic 12, Story 7 with comprehensive 15-step workflow
```

### Workflow Selection Validation
Both workflows include complexity validation warnings to ensure appropriate selection based on:
- Implementation scope and complexity
- Business logic requirements  
- Integration touchpoints
- Quality validation needs

## Workflow Selection Guide

| Criteria | story-simple | story-implementation |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Duration** | 2-3 days | 4-5 days |
| **Steps** | 9 optimized steps | 15 comprehensive steps |
| **Code Changes** | Single component focus | Multi-component integration |
| **Business Logic** | Minimal/none | Significant business rules |
| **Database Changes** | Read-only or minor | Schema changes, migrations |
| **Testing Scope** | Component-level | Integration and system-level |
| **Review Rounds** | Single efficient round | Multi-round comprehensive |

## Team Integration

### Agent Team Configuration
Add to your team configuration files:
```yaml
expansion_packs:
  - story-implementation

workflows:
  story_simple:
    trigger: "story-simple"
    agents: [sm, po, dev, architect]
  
  story_implementation:
    trigger: "story-implementation" 
    agents: [sm, po, dev, architect, qa, ux-expert, infra-devops-platform]
```

### Role Assignments
- **SM**: Workflow orchestration, process compliance, team coordination
- **PO**: Business validation, story approval, value assessment
- **Dev**: Implementation execution, code quality, technical fixes
- **Architect**: Technical validation, learning triage, system design
- **QA**: Quality gates, testing validation, defect management
- **UX-Expert**: User experience validation, design consistency
- **DevOps**: Environment setup, build integration, deployment readiness

## Learning System

### Six Learning Categories
1. **ARCH_CHANGE**: Architecture improvements and technical debt
2. **FUTURE_EPIC**: Epic candidates and feature opportunities  
3. **URGENT_FIX**: Critical issues requiring immediate attention
4. **PROCESS_IMPROVEMENT**: Development workflow enhancements
5. **TOOLING**: Infrastructure and automation improvements
6. **KNOWLEDGE_GAP**: Team training and skill development needs

### Learning Flow
```
Implementation → Learning Triage → Collaborative Review → Epic Integration → Retrospective
```

### Learning Integration
