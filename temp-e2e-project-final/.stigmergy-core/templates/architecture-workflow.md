# Architecture Workflow

## Overview
This document outlines the standard workflow for system architecture design and validation within the Stigmergy system.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Requirements Analysis
- Analyze functional and non-functional requirements
- Identify quality attributes (performance, scalability, security, etc.)
- Understand constraints and limitations
- Define success criteria for architecture

### 2. Architectural Design
- Define system boundaries and components
- Identify key architectural patterns
- Design data flow and interfaces
- Select appropriate technologies

### 3. Design Validation
- Validate design against requirements
- Assess architectural risks
- Review for scalability and performance
- Ensure security considerations are addressed

### 4. Documentation
- Create architectural diagrams
- Document key design decisions
- Specify component interfaces
- Define deployment architecture

### 5. Review and Approval
- Conduct architecture review with stakeholders
- Address feedback and concerns
- Get formal approval for architecture
- Establish baseline for implementation

## Architectural Principles

### Modularity
- Design for loose coupling and high cohesion
- Define clear component boundaries
- Minimize dependencies between modules

### Scalability
- Design for horizontal scaling when possible
- Consider load distribution strategies
- Plan for future growth

### Maintainability
- Design for easy updates and modifications
- Follow established patterns and practices
- Ensure clear documentation

### Security
- Apply security by design principles
- Implement defense in depth
- Consider data protection requirements

## Design Patterns

### Microservices
- Decompose system into independent services
- Define clear service contracts
- Implement service discovery and communication

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Use events for loose coupling
- Implement event sourcing where appropriate
- Design for eventual consistency

### Layered Architecture
- Separate concerns into distinct layers
- Define clear interfaces between layers
- Minimize cross-layer dependencies

## Quality Attributes

### Performance
- Define performance benchmarks
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Optimize critical paths

### Availability
- Design for fault tolerance
- Implement redundancy where needed
- Plan for disaster recovery

### Security
- Apply principle of least privilege
- Implement authentication and authorization
- Protect sensitive data

## Architecture Decision Records

Document all significant architecture decisions including:
- Context and problem statement
- Considered options
- Decision rationale
- Consequences and trade-offs
