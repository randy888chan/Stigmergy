# Execution Workflow

## Overview
This document outlines the standard workflow for executing development tasks within the Stigmergy system.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Task Preparation
- Review task requirements and acceptance criteria
- Gather necessary resources and tools
- Set up development environment

### 2. Implementation
- Follow test-driven development approach
- Write failing tests first
- Implement functionality to pass tests
- Refactor for clean code principles

### 3. Testing
- Run unit tests
- Execute integration tests
- Perform manual testing if required
- Validate against acceptance criteria

### 4. Code Review
- Self-review code for quality and standards
- Ensure code follows established patterns
- Document any deviations or special considerations

### 5. Deployment
- Package changes for deployment
- Deploy to appropriate environment
- Verify deployment success
- Monitor for any issues

## Quality Gates

### Code Quality
- All code must pass linting checks
- Code must meet established style guidelines
- Complexity metrics must be within acceptable ranges

### Test Coverage
- Minimum 80% code coverage required
- All new functionality must have tests
- Edge cases must be adequately covered

### Security
- All security checks must pass
- No known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Secure coding practices must be followed

## Best Practices

### Continuous Integration
- Integrate changes frequently
- Automate build and test processes
- Fix broken builds immediately

### Collaboration
- Communicate progress and blockers
- Seek help when needed
- Share knowledge and insights
