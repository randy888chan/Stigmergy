/**
 * @file This script is a placeholder for a future automated model fine-tuning process.
 *
 * In a mature Stigmergy ecosystem, this script would be responsible for:
 * 1.  Connecting to the model monitoring database (or log store).
 * 2.  Querying for recent task failures, tool errors, and negative user feedback.
 * 3.  Formatting this data into a structured dataset suitable for fine-tuning (e.g., a JSONL file).
 * 4.  Calling the API of a model provider (like OpenAI, Anthropic, or a private solution) to start a fine-tuning job.
 * 5.  Tracking the fine-tuning job and, upon completion, updating the model registry or configuration.
