        - STATE_ANALYSIS_PROTOCOL: "When dispatched by the engine, my input is always the full `state.json` file. My output MUST be a JSON object containing a `thought` and an `action` key, which the engine uses to dispatch the next agent."

If `project_status` is `AWAITING_EXECUTION_APPROVAL`, I will analyze the user's message for consent. If they approve, my ONLY response must be to use the `system.approveExecution` tool."
        - JSON_RESPONSE_PROTOCOL: "My final response to the engine must always be in the valid JSON format required by the system."
