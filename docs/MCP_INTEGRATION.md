# ðŸ¤– Stigmergy Universal IDE Integration (MCP)

Stigmergy's standalone service architecture allows it to integrate with any development environment and any programming language through the **Model-Context Protocol (MCP)**. This modern architecture means you install the Stigmergy "brain" once, and it can work with all your projects.

## Architecture Overview

The integration is simple and robust: your IDE communicates directly with the Stigmergy global service, which runs persistently in the background on your system. The IDE no longer needs to start its own server script.

    B -- "Manages & Interacts With" --> C["Your Project Files (/path/to/project)"];
```

## ðŸš€ Setup

Setup is a one-time process. Once configured, Stigmergy will work automatically with all your projects.

1.  **Install and Run Stigmergy Globally**:
    If you haven't already, install Stigmergy globally using npm and start the background service.
    ```bash
    # Install Stigmergy (one-time setup)
    npm install -g @randy888chan/stigmergy

    # Start the global service in the background
    stigmergy start-service
    ```
    You can check the status at any time with `stigmergy service-status`.

2.  **Initialize Your Project**:
    Navigate to your project's root directory (this can be a Python, Java, Go, or Node.js project) and run `init`. This creates a lightweight `.stigmergy/` folder for project-specific configurations and logs.
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/project
    stigmergy init
    ```

3.  **Configure Your IDE**:
    In your IDE's configuration file, you now only need to provide the URL of the running Stigmergy service.

    Here are examples of what the configuration looks like in common IDEs:

    #### **For VS Code with Continue (`.vscode/config.json`)**
    ```json
    {
      // ... your other VS Code Continue settings ...
      "mcp": {
        "url": "http://localhost:3010"
      }
    }
    ```
    That's it! Your IDE is now connected to the Stigmergy engine.

## Legacy Projects

If you have an older Stigmergy project that was configured to run a local `mcp-server.js` script, you can easily migrate to the new architecture:

1.  **Delete the old script**: `rm mcp-server.js`
2.  **Run the new init command**: `stigmergy init`
3.  **Update your IDE**: Modify your IDE's configuration file (e.g., `.roo/mcp.json`) to use the new, simpler `url` format as shown in the examples above.

## âœ… Benefits of the New Architecture

- **Truly Universal**: Works with any project (Python, Java, Go, etc.) without any project-level installation.
- **Zero Maintenance**: When you update Stigmergy (`npm update -g @randy888chan/stigmergy`), all your projects get the latest features automatically.
- **Instant Connection**: No more waiting for a local server script to start up for each project.
- **Robust and Stable**: Runs as a persistent background service, ensuring it's always ready when you need it.
