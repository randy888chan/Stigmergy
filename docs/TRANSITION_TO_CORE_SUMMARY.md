# Transition to .stigmergy-core Directory - Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the transition to the `.stigmergy-core` directory structure and the implementation of Specification-Driven Development (SDD) principles in the Stigmergy system.

## Directory Structure Changes

### Before
- Constitution and governance documents were in a separate `memory/` directory
- Agent definitions were in `.stigmergy-core/agents/`
- No clear governance structure

### After
- Constitution moved to `.stigmergy-core/governance/constitution.md`
- New governance directory for all constitutional and policy documents
- Removed the old `memory/` directory
- Added specification-driven development summary documentation

## Agent Enhancements

All key agents have been updated to be aware of and comply with the Stigmergy Constitution:

### System Orchestrator
- Added `SPECIFICATION_FIRST_PROTOCOL` to ensure all development work follows a specification-first approach
- Added `CONSTITUTIONAL_COMPLIANCE_PROTOCOL` to reference constitutional principles in decision-making

### Dispatcher
- Added `SPECIFICATION_DRIVEN_WORKFLOW_PROTOCOL` to enforce specification-driven workflows
- Added `CONSTITUTIONAL_COMPLIANCE_PROTOCOL` to ensure orchestration decisions comply with constitutional principles

### QA Agent
- Enhanced `CONSTITUTIONAL_COMPLIANCE_PROTOCOL` to verify compliance with all constitutional principles:
  - Test-First Imperative Verification
  - Simplicity and Anti-Abstraction Compliance
  - AI-Verifiable Outcomes Validation
  - Security Requirements Enforcement
  - Agent Communication Protocol Compliance

### Debugger
- Added `TEST_FIRST_DEBUGGING_PROTOCOL` to follow the constitutional Test-First Imperative
- Added `CONSTITUTIONAL_COMPLIANCE_PROTOCOL` to ensure debugging activities comply with constitutional principles

### Design Architect
- Added `REFERENCE_FIRST_ARCHITECTURE_PROTOCOL` to follow Reference-First Development
- Added `CONSTITUTIONAL_COMPLIANCE_PROTOCOL` to ensure architectural decisions comply with constitutional principles

### Reference Architect
- Added `SPECIFICATION_DRIVEN_WORKFLOW_PROTOCOL` to follow the Specification Process principle
- Added `CONSTITUTIONAL_COMPLIANCE_PROTOCOL` to ensure compliance with constitutional principles

### New Specification Agent
Created a new agent specifically for creating clear, unambiguous specifications:
- `SPECIFICATION_FIRST_PROTOCOL`: Ensures every feature starts with a clear, unambiguous specification
- `PLAN_FIRST_PROTOCOL`: Creates detailed technical plans before implementation
- `REFERENCE_ALIGNMENT_PROTOCOL`: Ensures specifications align with existing reference patterns
- `CONSTITUTIONAL_COMPLIANCE_PROTOCOL`: Ensures all specifications comply with constitutional principles

## System Validation

Enhanced the system validator to check for governance structure integrity:
- Validates the existence of the `.stigmergy-core/governance` directory
- Validates the presence of the constitution file
- Integrates governance validation into the comprehensive health check

## Benefits

1. **Centralized Governance**: All constitutional and governance documents are now in the `.stigmergy-core/governance` directory
2. **Agent Awareness**: All key agents are now explicitly aware of the constitutional principles and reference them in their workflows
3. **Specification-Driven Workflow**: The system now enforces a clear specification-first approach to all development work
4. **Constitutional Compliance**: Quality assurance processes now explicitly check for compliance with constitutional principles
5. **Improved Organization**: The `.stigmergy-core` directory structure is now more organized and easier to navigate
6. **Enhanced Validation**: System validation now includes governance structure checks

## Validation Results

All agent definitions have been validated and pass the validation checks. The enhanced system validator confirms that the governance structure is properly in place.

## Next Steps

1. Continue to refine the specification-driven workflow processes
2. Enhance agent collaboration around specifications and technical plans
3. Monitor the effectiveness of the constitutional compliance checks
4. Gather feedback from development workflows to further improve the SDD implementation
5. Consider adding more governance documents to the `.stigmergy-core/governance` directory as needed
