# Specification-Driven Development Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of Specification-Driven Development (SDD) principles in the Stigmergy system, focusing on moving to the `.stigmergy-core` directory structure and ensuring agents are aware of project-level documentation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Constitution and Governance Structure

- Moved `constitution.md` from `memory/` to `.stigmergy-core/governance/constitution.md`
- Removed the old `memory/` directory
- Established a clear governance structure within `.stigmergy-core`

### 2. Agent Updates for Constitutional Compliance

Updated multiple agents to be aware of and comply with the Stigmergy Constitution:

#### System Orchestrator (`system.md`)
- Added `SPECIFICATION_FIRST_PROTOCOL` to ensure all development work follows a specification-first approach
- Added `CONSTITUTIONAL_COMPLIANCE_PROTOCOL` to reference constitutional principles in decision-making

#### Dispatcher (`dispatcher.md`)
- Added `SPECIFICATION_DRIVEN_WORKFLOW_PROTOCOL` to enforce specification-driven workflows
- Added `CONSTITUTIONAL_COMPLIANCE_PROTOCOL` to ensure orchestration decisions comply with constitutional principles

#### QA Agent (`qa.md`)
- Enhanced `CONSTITUTIONAL_COMPLIANCE_PROTOCOL` to verify compliance with all constitutional principles:
  - Test-First Imperative Verification
  - Simplicity and Anti-Abstraction Compliance
  - AI-Verifiable Outcomes Validation
  - Security Requirements Enforcement
  - Agent Communication Protocol Compliance

#### Debugger (`debugger.md`)
- Added `TEST_FIRST_DEBUGGING_PROTOCOL` to follow the constitutional Test-First Imperative
- Added `CONSTITUTIONAL_COMPLIANCE_PROTOCOL` to ensure debugging activities comply with constitutional principles

#### Design Architect (`design-architect.md`)
- Added `REFERENCE_FIRST_ARCHITECTURE_PROTOCOL` to follow Reference-First Development
- Added `CONSTITUTIONAL_COMPLIANCE_PROTOCOL` to ensure architectural decisions comply with constitutional principles

#### Reference Architect (`reference-architect.md`)
- Added `SPECIFICATION_DRIVEN_WORKFLOW_PROTOCOL` to follow the Specification Process principle
- Added `CONSTITUTIONAL_COMPLIANCE_PROTOCOL` to ensure compliance with constitutional principles

### 3. New Specification Agent

Created a new `specifier.md` agent with the following protocols:
- `SPECIFICATION_FIRST_PROTOCOL`: Ensures every feature starts with a clear, unambiguous specification
- `PLAN_FIRST_PROTOCOL`: Creates detailed technical plans before implementation
- `REFERENCE_ALIGNMENT_PROTOCOL`: Ensures specifications align with existing reference patterns
- `CONSTITUTIONAL_COMPLIANCE_PROTOCOL`: Ensures all specifications comply with constitutional principles

## Key Benefits

1. **Centralized Governance**: All constitutional and governance documents are now in the `.stigmergy-core/governance` directory
2. **Agent Awareness**: All key agents are now explicitly aware of the constitutional principles and reference them in their workflows
3. **Specification-Driven Workflow**: The system now enforces a clear specification-first approach to all development work
4. **Constitutional Compliance**: Quality assurance processes now explicitly check for compliance with constitutional principles
5. **Improved Organization**: The `.stigmergy-core` directory structure is now more organized and easier to navigate

## Validation

- All agent definitions have been validated and pass the validation checks
- Engine server integration tests are passing
- The system maintains backward compatibility while adding new SDD capabilities

## Next Steps

1. Continue to refine the specification-driven workflow processes
2. Enhance agent collaboration around specifications and technical plans
3. Monitor the effectiveness of the constitutional compliance checks
4. Gather feedback from development workflows to further improve the SDD implementation
