- Process improvements
- Team workflow optimization

### UDTM Process Framework

#### Phase 1: Problem Definition & Scope
```bash
/analyst    # Deep problem analysis and research
/context    # Understand current state and constraints
/recall     # Leverage past experience and lessons learned
```

**Steps**:
1. **Define the problem clearly** - What exactly needs to be solved?
2. **Identify stakeholders** - Who is affected by this decision?
3. **Understand constraints** - What limitations must be considered?
4. **Gather relevant data** - What information is needed for good decision?

**Quality Checks**:
- [ ] Problem statement is specific and measurable
- [ ] All relevant stakeholders identified
- [ ] Constraints are realistic and well-understood
- [ ] Sufficient data available for informed decision

#### Phase 2: Multi-Perspective Analysis
```bash
/consult    # Bring together relevant personas for analysis
/insights   # Get AI-powered analysis and recommendations
/patterns   # Check for similar past situations and outcomes
```

**Steps**:
1. **Analyze from multiple perspectives** - Business, technical, user, operational
2. **Consider alternative approaches** - Generate multiple solution options
3. **Evaluate trade-offs** - Understand pros and cons of each approach
4. **Assess risks and mitigation** - What could go wrong and how to prevent it?

**Quality Checks**:
- [ ] Multiple valid perspectives considered
- [ ] At least 3 alternative approaches evaluated
- [ ] Trade-offs clearly understood and documented
- [ ] Risk mitigation strategies defined

#### Phase 3: Decision and Validation
```bash
/consensus-check    # Validate team agreement on decision
/remember          # Document decision rationale for future reference
/learn             # Update system intelligence with lessons learned
```

**Steps**:
1. **Make evidence-based decision** - Choose approach based on analysis
2. **Validate decision with stakeholders** - Ensure buy-in and understanding
3. **Document decision rationale** - Why this choice was made
4. **Plan implementation and monitoring** - How to execute and measure success

**Quality Checks**:
- [ ] Decision supported by evidence and analysis
- [ ] Stakeholder consensus achieved
- [ ] Decision rationale clearly documented
- [ ] Implementation plan includes success metrics

### Quality-Driven Decision Making

#### **Decision Quality Framework**
Every significant decision should consider:

1. **Quality Impact Assessment**
   - How does this decision affect code quality?
   - Will this make the system more or less maintainable?
   - Does this align with our quality standards?

2. **Long-term Quality Implications**
   - Will this decision create technical debt?
   - How will this affect future development velocity?
   - Does this support or hinder quality improvement?

3. **Quality Measurement Plan**
   - How will we measure the quality impact?
   - What metrics will tell us if this was a good decision?
   - When will we review the quality outcomes?
