### Issues Fixed (Test-Driven Approach)

A comprehensive test suite (`tests/integration/system_issues.test.js`) was created to identify and verify fixes for several core system inconsistencies.

1.  **Agent Definition Conflicts:**
    - **Problem:** Multiple agent definition files existed with conflicting `alias` properties (e.g., `mary.md` and `analyst.md` both using the `mary` alias).
    - **Fix:** The redundant and less-developed agent files (`mary.md`, `gemma.md`, `saul.md`) were removed, establishing the more detailed files as the canonical source.
    - **Verification:** The test case for unique agent IDs and aliases now passes.

2.  **Agent Manifest Inconsistency:**
    - **Problem:** The central agent manifest at `.stigmergy-core/system_docs/02_Agent_Manifest.md` was out of sync with the actual agent files in the `.stigmergy-core/agents/` directory. Additionally, several agent files had YAML syntax errors or were plain markdown, preventing them from being parsed.
    - **Fix:** All malformed agent files were corrected to have valid YAML syntax. The agent manifest was then updated to include a complete list of all valid agents.
    - **Verification:** The test case for manifest consistency now passes.

3.  **Build Process Failure:**
    - **Problem:** The `npm run build` command was failing because the CLI did not recognize the `build` command or its `--all` option.
    - **Fix:** A new `build` command was implemented in `cli/commands/build.js` and registered in `cli/index.js`. It now correctly bundles agent definitions into `dist/agents.json`.
    - **Verification:** The test case for the build process now passes.

4.  **Install Process & .roomodes Failure:**
    - **Problem:** The `npx stigmergy install` command was failing because the CLI did not recognize the `install` command.
    - **Fix:** A new `install` command was implemented in `cli/commands/install.js`. It correctly copies the `.stigmergy-core` directory and generates a `.roomodes` file based on the available agents.
    - **Verification:** The test case for the install process now passes.

5.  **Neo4j Connection Robustness:**
    - **Problem:** The `testConnection` method in the `code_intelligence_service` had a bug in its retry logic that caused a `TypeError`.
    - **Fix:** The retry logic was corrected to properly use promise-based timers. The method now correctly handles connection errors and returns a detailed status object instead of crashing.
    - **Verification:** The test case for the Neo4j connection now passes, correctly reporting a connection failure with dummy credentials without throwing an error.

### Conceptual Improvements Identified (Next Steps)

With the core system stabilized, the following conceptual improvements can now be pursued:

- **True Autonomous Orchestration:** The fix ensuring agent definitions are consistent and correctly loaded is foundational. To improve autonomy:
  - **Task:** Investigate enhancing the `@dispatcher` (Saul) logic in `services/dispatcher_service.js` (if it exists) or the core engine loop. Allow agents like `@pm` or `@design-architect` to propose new task sequences or sub-projects dynamically, not just react to a predefined list.
  - **Test:** Write a test that simulates an agent proposing a new task and verifies the system can schedule it.

- **Adaptive Swarm Intelligence:** The consistent agent base is key. To improve adaptability:
  - **Task:** Enhance `@dexter` (Error Handler) protocols and implementation. Define clearer escalation paths and recovery strategies within its code.
  - **Task:** Flesh out `@metis` (Meta/Learner) agent. Define concrete data collection points (e.g., task success/failure, agent performance metrics from `SwarmMemory`) and mechanisms for applying learning (e.g., adjusting trust scores, suggesting workflow changes).
  - **Test:** Write a test that simulates an error handled by `@dexter` and verifies the correct protocol steps are followed.

- **AI-Verifiable Outcomes:** Stable build/install/connections ensure tools work.
  - **Task:** Review and expand verification tools. Ensure `qa-protocol.md` and `SemanticValidator.js` cover broader aspects (security, architecture adherence) beyond syntax/linting.
  - **Test:** Write a test that validates a simple code change against the existing verification criteria.

- **Sophisticated Natural Language Interpretation:** Consistent agents mean consistent interpreters.
  - **Task:** Improve intent recognition in `services/intent_classifier.js` or `@saul`'s logic. Add more training data/examples to the classifier.
  - **Test:** Write a test with various natural language inputs and verify the correct intent/project state is identified.
