# Stigmergy Improvements Log

This document tracks the systematic improvements made to the Stigmergy repository, including technical fixes and plans for future conceptual enhancements.

## Session: 2025-08-06 - System Consistency and Test-Driven Fixes

### Issues Fixed

A comprehensive, test-driven approach was used to identify and resolve several core consistency issues in the system. The process involved first strengthening the existing test suite to accurately detect silent failures before fixing the underlying problems.

1.  **Agent Definition Conflicts & Inconsistencies:**
    - **Issue:** The build and install scripts were silently failing to parse three agent files (`error_handler.md`, `health_monitor.md`, `meta.md`) due to malformed YAML syntax. This resulted in an incomplete agent bundle. Additionally, a filename (`meta.md`) did not match the agent ID in the manifest (`metis`).
    - **Fix:**
      - The problematic agent files were renamed to use the correct `.yml` extension (e.g., `error_handler.yml`).
      - The `meta.md` file was renamed to `metis.yml` to align with the manifest.
      - The YAML content within these files was corrected to have the proper indentation.
      - The build, install, and test scripts were updated to search for both `.md` and `.yml` files, ensuring all agents are now correctly processed.

2.  **Duplicate Agent Alias:**
    - **Issue:** Once the YAML parsing was fixed, a new issue was revealed: the `debugger` and `error_handler` agents both shared the alias "dexter".
    - **Fix:** The conflicting alias and name were removed from `error_handler.yml` to ensure uniqueness, leaving "dexter" assigned to the `debugger` agent.

3.  **Build Process Integrity:**
    - **Issue:** The `npm run build` command would succeed even if it failed to parse some agent files, leading to an incomplete `dist/agents.json` bundle.
    - **Fix:** The integration test for the build process was enhanced to check that the number of bundled agents matches the number of source agent files, ensuring the build fails loudly if any agent cannot be processed.

4.  **Installation (`.roomodes`) Consistency:**
    - **Issue:** The `npx stigmergy install` command generated a `.roomodes` file based on its own (potentially flawed) parsing of agent files, not on a canonical source of truth.
    - **Fix:** The install process now correctly processes all agent files due to the YAML and filename fixes. The corresponding integration test was improved to be more robust.

5.  **Improved Error Handling (Neo4j):**
    - **Issue:** The test for the Neo4j connection was not correctly asserting the structure of the status object returned by the service.
    - **Fix:** The test was updated to correctly check the properties of the connection status object, making the test more reliable.

### Conceptual Improvements Identified (Roadmap)

The technical fixes above provide a stable foundation for pursuing the project's broader conceptual goals. The following is a proposed roadmap for these enhancements.

1.  **True Autonomous Orchestration:**
    - **Goal:** Move beyond a predefined task list to a system where agents can dynamically plan and execute new sub-projects.
    - **Task:** Enhance the `@dispatcher` (Saul) logic in `services/dispatcher_service.js` or the core engine loop. Allow agents like `@pm` or `@design-architect` to propose and queue new task sequences.
    - **Test:** Write a new integration test that simulates an agent proposing a new task and verifies the system can schedule and execute it.

2.  **Adaptive Swarm Intelligence:**
    - **Goal:** Enable the swarm to learn from its mistakes and improve its performance over time.
    - **Task 1:** Enhance `@dexter` (Error Handler) protocols. Define and implement clearer escalation paths and recovery strategies in its agent definition and the core error handling logic.
    - **Task 2:** Flesh out the `@metis` (Learner) agent. Define concrete data collection points (e.g., task success/failure rates, agent performance metrics from `SwarmMemory`) and implement mechanisms for applying learning, such as adjusting agent trust scores or suggesting workflow improvements.
    - **Test:** Write a test that simulates an error handled by `@dexter` and verifies the correct recovery protocol is followed. Write another test that simulates `@metis` analyzing performance data and proposing a change.

3.  **AI-Verifiable Outcomes:**
    - **Goal:** Ensure the AI's work is not just syntactically correct but also meets higher-level quality standards.
    - **Task:** Review and expand the system's verification tools, such as `qa-protocol.md` and `SemanticValidator.js`. Enhance them to cover broader aspects like security vulnerabilities, architectural adherence, and performance best practices.
    - **Test:** Write a test that validates a simple code change against both existing and new, more sophisticated verification criteria.

4.  **Sophisticated Natural Language Interpretation:**
    - **Goal:** Improve the system's ability to understand user intent and maintain context.
    - **Task:** Refine the intent recognition logic, likely located in `services/intent_classifier.js` or within the `@dispatcher` agent's initial processing steps. Add more training data or examples to improve the accuracy of the classifier.
    - **Test:** Create a test suite with a variety of natural language inputs and verify that the system correctly identifies the user's intent and transitions the project state accordingly.
