# Stigmergy Template Guidance

This document explains how to use Stigmergy's templates effectively.

## Purpose of Templates

Stigmergy uses templates to ensure consistency across project artifacts while providing flexibility for different project needs.

## Template Structure

Each template follows a consistent structure with clearly marked sections that should be filled in.

## Using Templates

1. Templates are automatically populated by the system agents
2. Manual edits should follow the structure guidelines
3. Custom templates can be created by following the same pattern

## Creating Custom Templates

To create a custom template:

1. Copy an existing template as a starting point
2. Modify the structure to meet your needs
3. Register it in the agent configuration
