# Deepcode integration

Thank you for that context. That is incredibly valuable information. It's one thing to analyze a project from the outside; it's another to understand the creator's own pain points. This shifts our discussion from a simple comparison to a strategic consultation on how to evolve Stigmergy to the next level.

You are absolutely right in your assessment. Your main concern—**code quality**—is the precise area where DeepCode's focused, reference-heavy approach offers a significant advantage. Let's break down *why* that is and then build a concrete, actionable plan for integrating these strengths into Stigmergy.

### Diagnosis: Why DeepCode's Approach Tends to Yield Higher Quality Code

Stigmergy, in its current form, is a **"generative-first" agentic system**. It excels at taking a high-level, abstract goal and generating a plausible path forward through research, planning, and then coding. This is a very difficult and broad task.

DeepCode is a **"reference-first" agentic system**. Its primary strength is not in generating code from a blank slate, but in **synthesizing and adapting high-quality existing information** (from research papers and reference codebases) into a new, functional codebase.

This distinction is the key to improving Stigmergy's code quality. High-quality code is rarely generated in a vacuum; it's almost always an adaptation of existing, proven patterns. DeepCode's architecture is built around this principle.

### The Strategic Blueprint: Evolving Stigmergy from a "Generator" to a "Synthesizer"

To improve code quality, we need to infuse Stigmergy with DeepCode's "reference-first" DNA. The goal is to modify the workflow so that by the time your execution agents (`@dev`, `@gemini-executor`, etc.) are activated, they are no longer *generating* code from a high-level plan. Instead, they will be **synthesizing** code based on a rich, technically-dense brief filled with concrete examples and patterns.

Here is a plan to integrate DeepCode's core advantages into Stigmergy.

### Actionable Integration Plan: What to Integrate into Stigmergy

#### 1. Integrate DeepCode's Document Processing & Segmentation Engine

This is the most critical and highest-impact integration. Stigmergy needs a robust way to ingest and understand dense, technical documents (your own PRDs, technical whitepapers, or even actual research papers) as a primary source of truth.

* **What to Borrow:**
  
  * `tools/pdf_converter.py` and `tools/pdf_downloader.py`: The ability to fetch and convert any document into clean Markdown.
  * `workflows/agents/document_segmentation_agent.py`: The "secret sauce." This agent doesn't just split a document; it analyzes it semantically to keep algorithms, concepts, and formulas coherent.

* **How to Integrate into Stigmergy:**
  
  1. Create a new Stigmergy tool called `document_intelligence`.
  2. This tool's functions (e.g., `document_intelligence.analyze_and_segment`) will be JavaScript wrappers that execute the Python scripts from DeepCode using `child_process`.
  3. Modify your **Context Preparer (`@context_preparer`) or Analyst (`@mary`) agents**. Their first step when receiving a technical goal should be to find relevant documents (or be given one) and use this new tool to process them.
  4. The output—a set of structured, segmented Markdown files—should be saved to the project's `docs/analysis/` directory. This becomes a foundational artifact for the entire workflow.

#### 2. Adopt a "Reference-First" Planning Phase

Before your execution agents start working, you need a phase that bridges the gap between the high-level plan and the low-level code.

* **What to Borrow:** The philosophy of the `workflows/codebase_index_workflow.py`. This workflow's purpose is to create a structured understanding of *how code is actually written* in reference repositories.

* **How to Integrate into Stigmergy:**
  
  1. Introduce a new planning agent, let's call it the **`@reference-architect`**. This agent runs *after* the `@design-architect` but *before* the execution team.
  2. This agent's sole job is to create a **"Technical Implementation Brief"**. To do this, it takes the PRD and the architectural plan and uses a new tool: `code_intelligence.find_reference_patterns`.
  3. This new tool would be powered by DeepCode's `code_reference_indexer.py`. It would scan your pre-indexed library of high-quality reference codebases (e.g., popular GitHub repos) for patterns, functions, and classes relevant to the task.
  4. The "Technical Implementation Brief" is not code. It's a Markdown document containing:
     * Recommended libraries and frameworks.
     * **Actual code snippets** from the reference indexes.
     * Descriptions of relevant design patterns (e.g., "Use a repository pattern for data access like in this reference file...").
     * Function signatures and data structures to use.

#### 3. Evolve the Execution Agents into "Code Synthesizers"

With the new artifacts from steps 1 and 2, your `@dev` and `@enhanced-dev` agents can now operate differently.

* **How to Evolve Stigmergy Agents:**
  1. **Modify the Core Protocol:** The *first* protocol for `@enhanced-dev` should now be: "CRITICAL: I MUST read the `Technical Implementation Brief.md` and any segmented document analysis in `docs/analysis/`. My primary goal is to synthesize the provided code snippets and patterns into a cohesive file that fits the existing architecture (discovered via the CodeRAG/Neo4j graph)."
  2. **Change the Prompting Strategy:** The prompts from the supervisor to these agents will no longer be "Implement feature X." They will be "Synthesize the code for the login component using the patterns and snippets in the Implementation Brief."

This fundamentally constrains the LLM, forcing it to ground its output in high-quality examples rather than generating less reliable code from scratch. This will be the single biggest driver of code quality improvement.

### Phased Implementation Plan to Make This Manageable

1. **Phase 1: Foundational Tooling (Document Intelligence)**
   
   * Port DeepCode's `pdf_converter`, `pdf_downloader`, and `document_segmentation` tools into Stigmergy as a single `document_intelligence` tool.
   * Enhance the `@analyst` agent to use this tool and save the output.

2. **Phase 2: Reference-First Workflow**
   
   * Build the `code-reference-indexer` from DeepCode and create a library of indexed reference repos.
   * Create the new `@reference-architect` agent and the `code_intelligence.find_reference_patterns` tool.
   * Have this agent produce the "Technical Implementation Brief."

3. **Phase 3: Agent Evolution**
   
   * Update the prompts and protocols for `@dev` and `@enhanced-dev` to use the new brief as their primary source material.
   * Measure the quality of the output. It should be significantly better.

### Addressing the Roo Code Integration Issue

Your concern about Roo Code integration is likely a symptom of the code quality problem. When an agentic system produces unpredictable, low-quality, or unstructured output, the communication back to the IDE client (Roo Code) can easily break down. The MCP protocol relies on structured, predictable tool calls and responses.

By implementing the changes above, you will be adding more structure and predictability to the entire workflow. The "Technical Implementation Brief" provides a much stronger "scaffold" for the LLM's reasoning process, making its subsequent tool calls and code outputs far more reliable. This increased reliability and structure will almost certainly resolve many of the integration issues you're seeing with Roo Code.
