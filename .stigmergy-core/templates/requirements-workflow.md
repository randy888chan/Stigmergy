# Requirements Gathering Workflow

## 1. Initial Analysis
- Review project brief and brainstorming documents
- Identify key user stories and business requirements
- Document assumptions and constraints
- **Output**: `requirements_analysis.md`

## 2. User Story Creation
- Convert requirements into user stories using the format: "As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"
- Define acceptance criteria for each story
- Prioritize stories using MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have)
- **Output**: `user_stories.md`

## 3. Technical Requirements
- Identify technical constraints and dependencies
- Document API requirements and integration points
- Specify data model and storage requirements
- **Output**: `technical_requirements.md`

## 4. Validation
- Review requirements with stakeholders for alignment
- Verify completeness and testability of requirements
- Document any gaps or ambiguities
- **Output**: `requirements_validation.md`

## 5. Finalization
- Freeze requirements for the current iteration
- Document version and approval
- Hand off to architecture team
- **Output**: `requirements_final.md`

## Critical Protocols
- RESEARCH_FIRST_PROTOCOL: "Before finalizing requirements, I MUST use `research.deep_dive` to verify market needs and competitive landscape."
- ASSUMPTION_DOCUMENTATION: "All assumptions must be explicitly documented and marked for verification."
- USER-CENTRICITY_ABOVE_ALL: "Requirements must prioritize user needs and business value over technical convenience."
