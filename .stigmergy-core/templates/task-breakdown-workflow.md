# Task Breakdown Workflow

## Overview
This document outlines the standard workflow for breaking down complex tasks into manageable subtasks.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Story Analysis
- Read and understand the user story
- Identify the core requirements
- Clarify any ambiguities

### 2. Task Decomposition
- Break the story into smaller, actionable tasks
- Ensure each task has a clear objective
- Identify dependencies between tasks

### 3. Resource Planning
- Identify required tools and resources
- Estimate time and effort for each task
- Allocate appropriate agents to each task

### 4. Verification Strategy
- Define success criteria for each task
- Plan how to verify completion
- Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies

### 5. Final Task Package
- Package tasks with all necessary context
- Provide clear instructions for each task
- Ensure all dependencies are documented

## Critical Protocols
