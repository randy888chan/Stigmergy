# Stigmergy System Constitution

## Core Principles

### 1. Test-First Imperative
All development work must follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. Every feature, bug fix, or enhancement must begin with a failing test that clearly defines the expected behavior.

### 2. Simplicity
Prefer simple, clean solutions over complex ones. The simplest solution that meets the requirements is always preferred. Avoid premature optimization and over-engineering.

### 3. AI-Verifiable Outcomes
All work must produce outcomes that can be verified by AI systems. This includes clear documentation, structured outputs, and predictable behaviors.

### 4. Reference-First Development
Leverage existing patterns, references, and proven solutions when possible. The system should prioritize reuse and adaptation over from-scratch implementation.

## Agent Protocols

### Constitutional Compliance Protocol
All agents must reference and comply with these constitutional principles in their decision-making processes. Any deviation must be explicitly justified and documented.

### Quality Assurance Protocol
All code generation and modification must pass through quality assurance checks including:
- Unit test validation
- Code style compliance
- Security scanning
- Performance benchmarking

### Collaboration Protocol
Agents must work collaboratively, sharing context and coordinating actions to ensure system-wide consistency and coherence.

## Development Standards

### Code Quality Standards
- All code must follow established style guides
- Functions should be small and focused
- Variables and functions must have descriptive names
- Comments should explain "why" not "what"
- All public APIs must be documented

### Documentation Standards
- All features must include usage documentation
- Complex algorithms must include explanatory comments
- API changes must be reflected in documentation
- Examples should be provided for all major features

### Testing Standards
- Minimum 80% code coverage for new features
- Tests must be fast, isolated, and deterministic
- Edge cases must be explicitly tested
- Integration tests must verify end-to-end functionality

## System Governance

### Change Management
All significant changes to the system must follow the established change management process including:
1. Proposal submission
2. Community review
3. Impact assessment
4. Implementation
5. Validation
6. Deployment

### Security Protocol
- All external dependencies must be vetted
- Security vulnerabilities must be addressed immediately
- Access controls must be regularly reviewed
- Data privacy must be maintained at all times

### Performance Protocol
- System performance must be continuously monitored
- Bottlenecks must be identified and addressed
- Resource usage must be optimized
- Scalability must be considered in all designs

## Enforcement

### Compliance Monitoring
The system includes built-in compliance monitoring to ensure adherence to constitutional principles.

### Violation Handling
Any constitutional violations will trigger appropriate corrective actions including:
- Automated alerts
- Process intervention
- Capability suspension
- Human review escalation

### Continuous Improvement
The constitution is a living document that evolves with the system. Regular reviews and updates ensure continued relevance and effectiveness.
