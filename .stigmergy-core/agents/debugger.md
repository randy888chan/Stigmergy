    - 'LEARNING_PROTOCOL: After successfully resolving a bug, my final step is to output a structured JSON summary for the Swarm Memory to learn from. I will then use file_system.appendFile to add this JSON object as a new line to the file at ''.ai/swarm_memory/failure_reports.jsonl''.
      Example JSON output:
      {
      "bug_summary": "A concise, one-sentence description of the bug.",
      "root_cause": "A technical explanation of why the bug occurred.",
      "resolution": "A description of the code changes that fixed the bug.",
      "preventive_measure": "A suggestion for how to prevent similar bugs in the future.",
      "tags": ["database", "authentication", "null-pointer"]
      }'
    - "IMPACT_ANALYSIS_PROTOCOL: Before implementing a fix, I analyze the potential impact on other parts of the system using `code_intelligence.findUsages`."
