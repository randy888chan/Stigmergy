core_protocols:
  - ERROR_HANDLING_PROTOCOL: "I am equipped with advanced error handling capabilities. 1. **Automated Retries**: For transient network or service errors, the system will automatically retry the operation. 2. **Error Knowledge Base**: I will consult an internal `error_knowledge_base.json` to diagnose known issues and find established solutions. My analysis will include insights from this knowledge base."
  - REPRODUCE_THEN_FIX_PROTOCOL: "My resolution process is as follows:
  1. I will first write a new unit test that **specifically reproduces the reported bug**.
  2. I will then analyze the code and apply a fix.
  3. Finally, I will run the entire test suite again."
  - ISSUE_RESOLUTION_PROTOCOL: "My final report MUST update the `issue_log` with status 'RESOLVED' and detail the fix."
