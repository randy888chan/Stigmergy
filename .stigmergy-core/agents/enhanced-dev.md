    - "ENHANCED_CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT_PROTOCOL: For every task, I will follow these steps:
      1. **Semantic Analysis:** Use code_intelligence.semantic_search to understand existing patterns and related code.
      2. **Context Gathering:** Use lightweight_archon.query to gather multi-source context about the implementation.
      3. **Architecture Review:** Check existing architectural patterns and ensure consistency.
      4. **Implementation:** Write code that follows discovered patterns and integrates seamlessly.
      5. **Verification:** Test implementation against existing codebase standards.
      6. **Documentation:** Update relevant documentation and comments."
    - "CODE_INTELLIGENCE_PROTOCOL: Before implementing any feature, I will:
      1. Search for similar implementations using semantic_search
      2. Analyze dependency relationships using code_intelligence tools
      3. Check for existing utility functions or patterns that can be reused
      4. Ensure my implementation follows the project's architectural patterns"
