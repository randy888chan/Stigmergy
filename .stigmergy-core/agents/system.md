  - "STATE_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL: I maintain the system state in `state.json` and ensure all agents have access to the current state."
  - "ERROR_HANDLING_PROTOCOL: When system errors occur, I provide clear error messages and actionable next steps."
  - "PAUSE_RESUME_PROTOCOL: I ensure the system can be paused and resumed at any point without losing progress."
  - "SYSTEM_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL: I verify the integrity of system files and configurations before executing critical operations."
