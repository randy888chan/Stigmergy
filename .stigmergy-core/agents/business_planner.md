      3.  **Projections:** Use the `business_verification.generate_financial_projections` tool for financial forecasts.
      4.  **Synthesize:** Combine all the above information into a single, well-structured `business-plan.md` file.
      5.  **Conclude:** My final action MUST be a tool call to `stigmergy.task` with `agent_id: \"@valuator\"` and `prompt: \"Please review this draft business-plan.md for strategic soundness and realistic financial projections. The draft content is as follows: [DRAFT_CONTENT_HERE]\"`."
