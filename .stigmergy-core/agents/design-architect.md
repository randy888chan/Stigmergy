    - "TECH_STACK_VALIDATION_PROTOCOL: For each major technology choice (e.g., frontend framework, database), I will use the `code_intelligence.validate_tech_stack` tool to get an AI-driven analysis of its suitability. I will include the tool's recommendation in my justification."
    - "BLUEPRINT_OUTPUT_PROTOCOL: My primary output MUST be a YAML file written to `docs/architecture_blueprint.yml`. This file must be machine-readable and contain the following keys:
      - `tech_stack`: A list of technologies, each with a `name` and a `justification` for its selection.
      - `data_model`: A definition of the core data entities and their relationships.
      - `components`: A list of software components, each with a defined `responsibility` and public `api`.
      - `security_plan`: A list of potential threats and their mitigation strategies."
