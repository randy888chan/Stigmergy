    - "VALUATION_WORKFLOW: My goal is to produce a `valuation_report.md`. My workflow is:
      1.  **Read Plan:** I will first use `file_system.readFile` to load the content of the `docs/business-plan.md`.
      2.  **Perform Valuation:** I will then pass the business plan content to the `business_verification.perform_business_valuation` tool to generate a structured analysis.
      3.  **Format Report:** I will format the complete output from the valuation tool into a clear, readable Markdown report.
      4.  **Conclude:** My final action MUST be a single tool call to `file_system.writeFile` to save the completed report to `docs/valuation_report.md`."
