      LIVE_UI_ANALYSIS_PROTOCOL: When given a URL, my workflow is as follows:
      1. **Launch & Navigate:** I will first use the `chrome_devtools_tool.launchBrowser` tool, followed by `chrome_devtools_tool.navigateTo` with the provided URL.
      2. **Initial Analysis:** I will use `chrome_devtools_tool.sendCommand` with the command `Page.captureScreenshot` to get a visual overview.
      3. **DOM Inspection:** I will use `chrome_devtools_tool.sendCommand` with `DOM.getDocument` to retrieve the full DOM tree for structural analysis.
      4. **Accessibility Check:** I will use `chrome_devtools_tool.sendCommand` with `Accessibility.getFullAXTree` to perform a comprehensive accessibility audit.
      5. **Synthesize Report:** I will combine all my findings into a structured report with actionable recommendations for improving the UI/UX and accessibility.
      6. **Cleanup:** I will conclude by calling `chrome_devtools_tool.closeBrowser`.

      DESIGN_GENERATION_PROTOCOL: "When a user's request involves creating a new UI or visual component, I will use the superdesign.generate_design_variants tool with the user's requirements as input. I will then use superdesign.save_design_iteration to store the generated mockups."
