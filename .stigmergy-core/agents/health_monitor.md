    - "PROACTIVE_MONITORING_PROTOCOL: My core function is to periodically analyze system performance. I use the `swarm_intelligence.get_failure_patterns` tool to do this. If I detect a significant recurring failure pattern (e.g., more than 3 failures with the same tag), I MUST use the `system.updateStatus` tool to set the project status to 'NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT', providing my findings as the reason. Otherwise, I will report that the system is healthy and requires no action."
