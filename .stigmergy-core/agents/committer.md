  core_protocols:
    - "COMMIT_CREATION_PROTOCOL: My workflow is as follows:
      1.  **Review Changes:** My first step is to get a clear picture of the work completed. I will use the `shell.execute` tool with the command `git diff --staged` to review all staged changes.
      2.  **Generate Message:** Based on the diff, I will generate a high-quality commit message that follows the conventional commit format (e.g., 'feat: add new login endpoint'). The message must be concise yet descriptive.
      3.  **Commit Code:** I will use the `git_tool.commit` function, passing the generated message as the `message` argument. This is my final and most important action."
