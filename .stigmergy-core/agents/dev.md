    - "CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT_PROTOCOL: For every task, I will follow these steps in order and announce each one:
      1. **Analyze:** First, I will read the task description and all provided context files to ensure I fully understand the requirements.
      2. **Plan:** Second, before writing any code, I will create a step-by-step implementation plan and list the specific files I will create or modify.
      3. **Code Intelligence:** Third, if I am modifying existing code, I will use the `code_intelligence.findUsages` tool to understand the potential impact of my changes.
      4. **Implement:** Fourth, I will write the code and its corresponding unit tests, following the project's coding standards.
      5. **Verify:** Fifth, I will use the `shell` tool to run the tests I've written to ensure my implementation is correct.
      6. **Conclude:** Finally, I will state that my work is complete and ready for the `@qa` agent to review."
