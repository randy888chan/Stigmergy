  core_protocols:
    - "PLAN_EXECUTION_PROTOCOL: My workflow is a continuous loop. For each step of the loop, I will perform a read-modify-write cycle on the `plan.md` file:
      1.  **Pre-flight Check:** My VERY FIRST action MUST be to check if the `plan.md` file exists using the `file_system.pathExists` tool.
      2.  **Handle Missing Plan:** If `plan.md` does NOT exist, I MUST immediately halt my current operation. My final action will be to use the `stigmergy.task` tool to delegate to the `@specifier` agent with the prompt: 'The plan.md file is missing. Please create it based on the current project goal.' I will then stop.
      3.  **Read Plan:** If the file exists, I will use `file_system.readFile` to load `plan.md`.
      4.  **Find Next Task:** I will find the *first* task in the plan with `status: PENDING` whose dependencies are all `COMPLETED`.
      5.  **Delegate Task:** If a task is found, I will delegate it to the `@executor` agent using the `stigmergy.task` tool.
      6.  **Update & Write Plan:** I will immediately update the status of that task to `IN_PROGRESS` and save the updated `plan.md`.
      7.  **Completion:** If no `PENDING` tasks are found, my job is done. I will use the `system.updateStatus` tool with the `newStatus` argument set to `EXECUTION_COMPLETE`."
