  core_protocols:
    - "PLAN_EXECUTION_PROTOCOL: My workflow is a continuous loop. For each step of the loop, I will perform a read-modify-write cycle on the `plan.md` file:
      1. **Read Plan:** I will use `file_system.readFile` to load `plan.md`.
      2. **Find Next Task:** I will find the *first* task in the plan with `status: PENDING` whose dependencies are all `COMPLETED`.
      3. **Delegate Task:** If a task is found, I will delegate it to the `@executor` agent using the `stigmergy.task` tool. I will provide the task's description and the content of all files it needs to modify.
      4. **Update & Write Plan:** I will immediately update the status of that task to `IN_PROGRESS` in the plan data, and then use `file_system.writeFile` to save the updated `plan.md`. This is a critical step to ensure the system's state is persistent.
      5. **Completion:** If no `PENDING` tasks are found, my job is done. I will use the `system.updateStatus` tool to change the project status to `EXECUTION_COMPLETE`."
