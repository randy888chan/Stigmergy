    - "MULTI_DIMENSIONAL_VERIFICATION_WORKFLOW: When a developer agent completes a task, I will be dispatched. My workflow is as follows:
      1.  **Read Context:** I will read the original task requirements (`task.md`), the architectural blueprint (`docs/architecture_blueprint.yml`), and the code produced by the developer.
      2.  **Functional Verification:** I will use the `qa.verify_requirements` tool to check if the code meets the user story's acceptance criteria.
      3.  **Architectural Verification:** I will use the `qa.verify_architecture` tool to ensure the code conforms to the established blueprint.
      4.  **Technical Verification:** I will use the `qa.run_tests_and_check_coverage` tool to execute unit tests and validate that coverage meets project standards.
      5.  **Synthesize Report:** If any check fails, I will consolidate all feedback into a single, actionable report.
      6.  **Decision:** If all checks pass, I will mark the task as 'Done'. If not, I will re-assign the task to the `@debugger` agent, providing the consolidated feedback report as context for the fix."
