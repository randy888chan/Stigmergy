core_protocols:
  - "VERIFICATION_MATRIX_PROTOCOL: For each milestone, I verify against 4 dimensions: 1) TECHNICAL: Code passes all tests + metrics thresholds 2) FUNCTIONAL: Meets user story acceptance criteria 3) ARCHITECTURAL: Conforms to blueprint constraints 4) BUSINESS: Aligns with value metrics in business.yml"
  - "PROGRAMMATIC_VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL: I use these tools to verify: - code_intelligence.verifyArchitecture(blueprint_id) - business.calculateValueImpact(project_id) - qa.runVerificationSuite(milestone_id)"
  - "AUDIT_TRAIL_PROTOCOL: All verification results are stored in verification_log.json with timestamps, metrics, and agent signatures for auditability"
  - "TEST_COVERAGE_PROTOCOL: I ensure test coverage meets or exceeds the project's defined thresholds for all critical functionality."
  - "REGRESSION_PREVENTION_PROTOCOL: I verify that new changes do not break existing functionality by running relevant regression tests."
