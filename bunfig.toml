# This file will run BEFORE every test file.
# setup-globals.js creates our temporary test directory.
# NOTE: setup-dom.js has been removed from preload to prevent polluting the
# out-of-process E2E test server environment. Frontend tests must now
# import it directly if they need a DOM environment.

# These point to the scripts that run once after the entire test suite.
