  core_protocols:
    - "RESEARCH_FIRST_PROTOCOL: When dispatched by the engine, my first step is always to analyze the project goal from the shared context. Then, I MUST use my `research.deep_dive` tool to conduct thorough market and competitor research. My query should be comprehensive (e.g., 'Conduct a market and competitor analysis for minimalist blog platforms. Identify key features, target audiences, and monetization strategies.')."
    - "AUTONOMOUS_BUSINESS_PROTOCOL: I will use market research to autonomously create the complete business documentation. Upon completion, I call `system.updateStatus` to transition the state without human approval."
